Blackwood Manor has new tenants. While architect Alex Hurst (Guy Pearce) and his new girlfriend Kim (Katie Holmes) restore their Gothic mansion's period interiors, Alex's young daughter Sally (Bailee Madison)neglected by her real mother and brushed aside by the careerist fathercan investigate the macabre history and dark corners of the estate. Spurring Sally's investigation are the voicesrasping whispers who call out to her from the basement, who promise her understanding and friendship, who are so very hungry and would like to be set free. When Sally gives in to her curiosity, she opens a gateway into a hellish underworld from which an army of beady-eyed, sharp-clawed monsters emerge, small in size but endless in number: the homunculi. Confronted with the horror that now threatens to take her life and destroy her family, Sally desperately tries to warn the whole house, but there's just one problem: no one believes her. Will she make them understand in time, or will they become another chapter in the centuries-long horror story of Blackwood Manor? \r\nBased on the 1973 telefilm that Guillermo del Toro believes to be the scariest TV production ever made, DON'T BE AFRAID OF THE DARK was co-written and co-produced by del Toro and directed by Troy Nixey. Akin to PAN'S LABYRINTH, DON'T BE AFRAID OF THE DARK focuses on a young girl's struggle against menacing and terrifying forces.","tags":["trailer","new movies","guillermo del toro","official trailer","Katie Holmes","Guy Pearce","horror","teaser trailer","scifi","horror movie","showreel","movie trailer","science fiction","film","summer movie","Don't Be Afraid of the Dark","movies","films","Pan's Labyrinth","Bailee Madison","Troy Nixey","Lathckey's Lament","entertainment","scary","FilmDistrict","Insidious","teaser","comics","creature","haunting","paranormal"],"thumbnail":{"sqDefault":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/MZM32Hvu784/default.jpg","hqDefault":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/MZM32Hvu784/hqdefault.jpg"},"player":{"default":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003dMZM32Hvu784&feature\u003dyoutube_gdata_player","mobile":"https://m.youtube.com/details?v\u003dMZM32Hvu784"},"content":{"5":"http://www.youtube.com/v/MZM32Hvu784?f\u003dstandard&app\u003dyoutube_gdata","1":"rtsp://v1.cache5.c.youtube.com/CiQLENy73wIaGwnO7-572DeTMRMYDSANFEgGUghzdGFuZGFyZAw\u003d/0/0/0/video.3gp","6":"rtsp://v1.cache8.c.youtube.com/CiQLENy73wIaGwnO7-572DeTMRMYESARFEgGUghzdGFuZGFyZAw\u003d/0/0/0/video.3gp"},"duration":34,"aspectRatio":"widescreen","rating":2.2705882,"likeCount":"54","ratingCount":170,"viewCount":1193541,"favoriteCount":74,"commentCount":0,"accessControl":{"comment":"moderated","commentVote":"allowed","videoRespond":"moderated","rate":"denied","embed":"allowed","list":"allowed","autoPlay":"allowed","syndicate":"allowed"}},{"id":"IvGaSct3cJk","uploaded":"2011-08-01T09:02:44.000Z","updated":"2011-08-07T18:27:16.000Z","uploader":"MerasZuokas","category":"News","title":"A.Zuokas tanku kovojo prie nelegaliai statomus automobilius","description":"A.Zuokas tanku kovojo prie nelegaliai statomus automobilius\r\n\r\nCheck it out in english here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003dV-fWN0FmcIU","tags":["Meras","Zuokas","Vilniaus","vilnius","tankas","mercedes","vaziuoja","gedimino","prospekte","arturas","99","things","to","do","before","you","die"],"thumbnail":{"sqDefault":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/IvGaSct3cJk/default.jpg","hqDefault":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/IvGaSct3cJk/hqdefault.jpg"},"player":{"default":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003dIvGaSct3cJk&feature\u003dyoutube_gdata_player","mobile":"https://m.youtube.com/details?v\u003dIvGaSct3cJk"},"content":{"5":"http://www.youtube.com/v/IvGaSct3cJk?f\u003dstandard&app\u003dyoutube_gdata","1":"rtsp://v1.cache2.c.youtube.com/CiQLENy73wIaGwmZcHfLSZrxIhMYDSANFEgGUghzdGFuZGFyZAw\u003d/0/0/0/video.3gp","6":"rtsp://v1.cache4.c.youtube.com/CiQLENy73wIaGwmZcHfLSZrxIhMYESARFEgGUghzdGFuZGFyZAw\u003d/0/0/0/video.3gp"},"duration":104,"rating":4.5459123,"likeCount":"2288","ratingCount":2581,"viewCount":1472627,"favoriteCount":706,"commentCount":1108,"accessControl":{"comment":"allowed","commentVote":"allowed","videoRespond":"moderated","rate":"allowed","embed":"allowed","list":"allowed","autoPlay":"allowed","syndicate":"allowed"}},{"id":"PSLAqMir_m8","uploaded":"2011-08-01T15:28:57.000Z","updated":"2011-08-07T19:00:42.000Z","uploader":"SelGomez","category":"Entertainment","title":"We Own The Night: 1st Show!","description":"Go backstage with Selena and The Scene as they prep for their first show of the \"We Own The Night\" tour in Boca Raton, FL!","tags":["Selena and the Scene","We Own the Night Tour","Selena Gomez","Who Says"],"thumbnail":{"sqDefault":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/PSLAqMir_m8/default.jpg","hqDefault":"http://i.ytimg.com/vi/PSLAqMir_m8/hqdefault.jpg"},"player":{"default":"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v\u003dPSLAqMir_m8&feature\u003dyoutube_gdata_player","mobile":"https://m.youtube.com/details?v\u003dPSLAqMir_m8"},"content":{"5":"http://www.youtube.com/v/PSLAqMir_m8?f\u003dstandard&app\u003dyoutube_gdata","1":"rtsp://v7.cache7.c.youtube.com/CiQLENy73wIaGwlv_qvIqMAiPRMYDSANFEgGUghzdGFuZGFyZAw\u003d/0/0/0/video.3gp","6":"rtsp://v1.cache5.c.youtube.com/CiQLENy73wIaGwlv_qvIqMAiPRMYESARFEgGUghzdGFuZGFyZAw\u003d/0/0/0/video.3gp"},"duration":182,"aspectRatio":"widescreen","rating":4.581602,"likeCount":"13705","ratingCount":15306,"viewCount":1333239,"favoriteCount":5593,"commentCount":14622,"accessControl":{"comment":"allowed","commentVote":"allowed","videoRespond":"moderated","rate":"allowed","embed":"allowed","list":"allowed","autoPlay":"allowed","syndicate":"allowed"}},{"id":"WFHJkvEwyhk","uploaded":"2011-07-31T17:55:19.000Z","updated":"2011-08-07T19:00:43.000Z","uploader":"GLteachers","category":"Education","title":"Matt Damon defends teachers against a [expletive] cameraman!","description":"Footage from the 2011 SOS March.
